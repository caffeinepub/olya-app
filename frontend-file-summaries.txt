  "frontend/src/utils/ethicalConstraints.ts": "New ethical constraints enforcement utility that detects four violation types (personal-attack, manipulative-framing, dehumanizing-language, coercive-pressure) using regex patterns, returning an EnforcementResult with isViolation, violationType, and sanitizedText.",
  "frontend/src/utils/patternPredictionEngine.ts": "New client-side pattern prediction engine that analyzes transcript entry trends (emotion, intent, negotiation direction) using heuristic frequency analysis and transition probability estimation to generate PatternPrediction objects.",
  "frontend/src/utils/trustworthinessScoreCalculator.ts": "New trustworthiness score calculator that computes a 0-100 score by applying weighted penalties for bias incidents, ethical violations, and hallucination flag rates.",
  "frontend/src/components/EthicsBadge.tsx": "Extended EthicsBadge component that displays bias category labels and ethical violation types; fixes the TypeScript error by computing the status label before rendering instead of calling formatViolationType with a potentially-undefined value inline.",
