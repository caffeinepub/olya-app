  "summary": "The diff implements changes primarily in Dashboard.tsx and useQueries.ts that address REQ-5: fixing the New Session button. The handleNewSession function in Dashboard.tsx calls createSession.mutateAsync, sets the active session, and shows toasts. However, the diff does not show changes to SessionManager.tsx that wire the New Session button to handleNewSession, and the SessionManager.tsx file summary does not mention a New Session button fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "The New Session button in SessionManager must be wired to the session creation handler so clicking it invokes handleNewSession, updates the session list, and selects the newly created session as the active session.",
      "reason": "The diff shows handleNewSession is implemented in Dashboard.tsx and passed down, but the SessionManager.tsx file summary only mentions delete button fixes and session cards with no mention of a New Session button being connected to the handler. Without seeing SessionManager.tsx changes, the button wiring cannot be confirmed.",
