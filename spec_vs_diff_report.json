  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by fixing session creation across multiple layers: adding a useEnsureUserRole hook in useQueries.ts that assigns the user role after login (which was likely the root cause of backend createSession failures), updating App.tsx to call ensureUserRole.mutate() once the actor is ready, and updating Dashboard.tsx to check authentication and provide success/error feedback. The useCreateSession mutation correctly invalidates the sessions query on success. The changes appear to cover all five acceptance criteria.",
