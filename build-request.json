      "text": "Fix the New Session button in SessionManager so that clicking it creates a new session. The button must trigger the session creation handler (e.g., calling the backend createSession mutation via the existing useQueries hook), update the session list in the UI, and select the newly created session as the active session.",

  "nonGoals": [
    "Redesigning the SessionManager UI beyond fixing the button functionality.",
